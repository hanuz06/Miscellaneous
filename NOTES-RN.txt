Styles are applied to View component itself, and not to View component's children; styles applied to Text component also applied to Text component's children;
Text component doesn't use Flexbox;
For images with uri we must put width and height as RN can't figure out the image size from internet; for local images usually it is not necessary provided images are perfectly sized;
Text automatically wraps. To disable text wrapping use numberOfLines and ellipsizeMode props;

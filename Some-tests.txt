How would you go about simplifying a complex issue in order to explain it to a client or colleague?

Which statements about the render method of a React.Component are true?


It can return a single element/component, as well as sibling DOM elements such as <p>foo</p><p>bar</p>.


It should be a pure function of props/state, although other side effects (such as calling new Date() or Math.random()) don't necessarily break the application rendering.


Modifying the state within render always leads to infinite render loops.


Modifying the state within render doesn't necessarily lead to infinite render loops depending on the implementation.

=================================

Write a higher-order React component that will add 1 to each numeric property passed to the component.

For example, if there is a component defined as

const Add = ({a, b}) => <span>{a} + {b} = {a+b}</span>;
If we then wrap the component in the HOC and render it

const WrappedAdd = wrap(Add);

<WrappedAdd a={1} b={2} />
It will render "2 + 3 = 5".

You can use any lodash (or similar) functions if you need to.

-------------

// this is component
const newComponent = ({num}) => num;

// this is component
const WithNumber = Component => {

	const intermediateComponent = ({number, ...props})=>{
	 	return <Component {...props} num={number+1}/>
	}
	return intermediateComponent;
}

const SpecificComponent = WithNumber(newComponent);

<SpecificComponent number={1} />
